## Purpose

This document is intended to as a guide for the Unlocking Our Sound Heritage (UOSH) natioanl partners to transfer and accurately capture audio data from Compact Disc.

## Technology

The Compact Disc is a digital optical storage format; data is encoded as a stream of binary digits, read by a laser beam in an optical disc drive.  The accuracy of the data transmitted during capture is heavily influenced by the quality of data written to the disc, its physical condition and the reliability of the optical drive.
Format types

There are two primary physical disc types: a mass-replicated, pre-recorded “Audio CD” (CD) and a Compact Disc Recordable (CD-R).  Both can be played in standard Audio CD players but vary in physical construction and data writing.  

### Physical Structure
A CD consists of a transparent polycarbonate base, a reflective aluminium layer, an acrylic core and a label/lacquer surface.  The data stream on a CD is pressed into the acrylic layer and coated with the reflective aluminium, in a controlled factory environment; the data is represented as a series of Pits and Lands which either reflect or deflect the optical laser in sequence with the binary stream. 

A CD-R has a similar construction to a CD, but instead of a pressed aluminium/acrylic core, the data is written to the disc by changing the reflective properties of a photosensitive dye layer.  The dye is “burnt” in an off-the-shelf CD-writer, turning sectors opaque in sequence with the data stream.  As with the Pits/Lands of a manufactured CD, the change in status between reflective and opaque (burnt) sectors represents the binary digits.
 
### Format Identification
It is important to identify the disc type so it can be accurately described for Stage 1 Cataloguing.  A CD will usually have a metallic silver underside (though some discs are black); CD-Rs will be a variety of different colours, due to the dyes used, with the most common being either blue, green, or gold.  Be aware - discs in the collection might be another format, such as CD-RW or a DVD variation.

It is also necessary to establish if the audio is written to the disc as a stream of bits, stored as data files, or as a combination of both.  As the focus of the Unlocking Our Sound Heritage project is audio, only the audio content (in certain formats) will be captured for preservation.

Compact Disc Digital Audio (CD-DA) is standardised in the Red Book format; the signal is stored as a stream of bits, encoded as 2-channel, Linear-PCM digital audio with a Sample Rate of 44.1 kHz and a bit-depth of 16.  Audio encoded as CD-DA can be played back in all Audio CD players.  There are other Standard Books represented by different colours, such as Data (Yellow) and mixed-mode (Orange) CDs. 

Audio recorded as CD-DA or Data CDs containing WAV files are In-Scope for preservation.  Data CDs containing other audio file formats, such as MP3, are Out-of-Scope (OOS); non-audio content types, such as images, video, transcripts etc. are also OOS.  

Mixed-mode CDs that contain CD-DA and ancillary data content, are In-Scope.  However - only the audio content should be captured for preservation and the additional data content ignored.
Error detection & correction
When read, the data stream on a disc will always produce errors; this is due to the sheer amount of encoded data and the physical limits of the medium and hardware.  The error detection and correction system employed for Compact Disc, known as Cross-Interleaved Reed-Solomon Code (CIRC), is an essential part of the data writing/reading process and replay mechanics of an optical drive.  

During the transfer process, the CIRC system will try to correct any errors in the bit stream, if an error passes through each stage of the system without being corrected, the error will be reported as “un-correctable” (C2).  

At the point a disc drive is unable to correct errors, it will then try to mask them through Interpolation techniques, such as Sample-Hold and Muting.  A high rate of Interpolation will become audible to the listener and is commonly described as a CD “skipping”.  This is a subjective process of “hiding” errors and should be avoided, where possible.

## Transfer & Capture Workflow

### Preparation

The physical condition of a disc will heavily impact an optical drive’s ability to accurately extract data from it.  So it is important that any preparation work does not potentially compromise the disc – avoid sticking labels to or writing on the surface of a disc, as the glue/ink can affect the chemical stability of the carrier.  If poorly affixed, a label will also cause imbalances and affect a drive’s ability to read the data accurately.  

If a disc already has a label affixed to the surface, then it should not be removed as any remedial action has the potential to damage the disc further.  

Discs should be cleaned of any stains or marks (fingerprints etc.) using a microfiber cloth - wiping the disc’s surface
